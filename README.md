I'm (currently) a Web Developer, working my way through this pandemic madness.

* Father to a marvellous/beautiful little girl (Chloe);
* Trying to master some JavaScript tools (React, Angular, etc.);
* Reading as much as I can...Considering the time I have left...ðŸ˜„
* Convincing myself to overcome my Impostor Syndrome and start publishing.
